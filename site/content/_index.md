  heading: What we offer
  text: >-
    Monumental Me employs the principle of activation triggers to help people
    achieve their goals. Being the polar opposite to idiom "out of sight, out of
    mind", activation triggers are items placed in key locations to spark
    thoughts, memories, and most importantly, action.


    We believe the best activation triggers are specific to the situation, so we start by helping you and your employees explore the details of the goals being aimed at, and map out the steps required to achieve them.


    We then use this information to design and craft personalised displays to be hung in key locations within homes and offices, which help gently nudge people towards their desires outcome.

    text: We offer a small, but carefully curated selection of brewing gear and

      fall in love with in our shop.

  heading: Our values
  text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too –
    one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives.
    We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
